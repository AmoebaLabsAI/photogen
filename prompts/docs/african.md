SDXL Africans Integration Guide
Introduction
The SDXL-Africans model, created by Maurice "Pellosh" Bidilou, specializes in generating images inspired by photography in the Congo during the 1970s. This guide will help you integrate this model into your application using Replicate’s API.

Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:

Node.js installed on your system.
A valid Replicate API token.
Basic familiarity with JavaScript.
Step 1: Setting Up the Environment
Install Replicate’s Node.js Client Library: Run the following command in your terminal to install the Replicate library:

bash
Copy code
npm install replicate
Set the REPLICATE_API_TOKEN Environment Variable: Replace your_token_here with your actual Replicate API token:

bash
Copy code
export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
For more details on setting up authentication, refer to Replicate’s authentication guide.

Step 2: Writing the Integration Script
Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., sdxlAfricansIntegration.js) and use the following code to generate an image:

javascript
Copy code
import Replicate from "replicate";

const replicate = new Replicate();

const input = {
    prompt: "A photo of two african women dressed in traditional Wax fabrics, standing with arms crossed, 1970s Congo",
    num_outputs: 4,
    prompt_strength: 0.91
};

const runSDXLAfricans = async () => {
    try {
        const output = await replicate.run(
            "svngoku/sdxl-africans:052925cac816ec9dc40a3adee633dacd90a32a8fc7db629ea0d056da9ab2b374",
            { input }
        );
        console.log(output);
        // => URLs of generated images, e.g., ["https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/5F5LrevTgoSjO6NX5FKW189..."]
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error running sdxl-africans:", error);
    }
};

runSDXLAfricans();
Explanation of Inputs:
prompt: The description of the image to be generated.
num_outputs: The number of images to generate.
prompt_strength: How closely the model should follow the text prompt.
Step 3: Running the Script
Run your script using Node.js:

bash
Copy code
node sdxlAfricansIntegration.js
If successful, the URLs of the generated images will appear in your terminal. You can use these URLs to embed the images in your web application.

Example Output
json
Copy code
{
  "completed_at": "2024-09-01T19:30:15.374Z",
  "created_at": "2024-09-01T19:29:50.262Z",
  "input": {
    "prompt": "A photo of two african women dressed in traditional Wax fabrics, standing with arms crossed, 1970s Congo",
    "num_outputs": 4,
    "prompt_strength": 0.91
  },
  "output": [
    "https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/5F5LrevTgoSjO6NX5FKW189",
    "https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/3JG8XYZ29dMJwLg4RsPQ7J2",
    "https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/9GF8TYk4DAsf73M1dXKlmPo",
    "https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/2R4JKpoDQ1gYz7UyqVmObc9"
  ],
  "status": "succeeded"
}
Step 4: Displaying the Generated Image on a Web Page
Use the following HTML code to display the images on a web page:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>SDXL Africans Images</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Generated Images from SDXL Africans</h1>
    <img src="https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/5F5LrevTgoSjO6NX5FKW189" alt="Generated Image 1">
    <img src="https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/3JG8XYZ29dMJwLg4RsPQ7J2" alt="Generated Image 2">
    <img src="https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/9GF8TYk4DAsf73M1dXKlmPo" alt="Generated Image 3">
    <img src="https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/2R4JKpoDQ1gYz7UyqVmObc9" alt="Generated Image 4">
</body>
</html>
Replace the src attributes with the URLs from your script's output.

Step 5: Handling File Inputs (Optional)
This model also supports file inputs. You can provide an image via a URL, local file, or base64 data URI. Here’s an example using a local file:

javascript
Copy code
import { readFile } from "node:fs/promises";

const image = await readFile("./path/to/my/image.png");

const input = {
    prompt: "A photo of two african women dressed in traditional Wax fabrics, standing with arms crossed, 1970s Congo",
    num_outputs: 4,
    prompt_strength: 0.91,
    image: image
};

const output = await replicate.run("svngoku/sdxl-africans:052925cac816ec9dc40a3adee633dacd90a32a8fc7db629ea0d056da9ab2b374", { input });
console.log(output);
This allows you to augment the image generation process with specific image inputs.

Conclusion
You’ve successfully integrated the SDXL-Africans model into your application using Replicate’s API. You can now generate beautiful, 1970s-style African photography-based images based on detailed prompts and display them in your applications.
